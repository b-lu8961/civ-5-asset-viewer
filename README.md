# civ-5-asset-viewer
Program to see art and hear music from Civilization V (including G&K + BNW).
The text driven menu sorts wonders either alphabetically or by era (then alphabetically) by referencing the csv file.
Then, it creates a JFrame that shows the art and starts a thread (with the help of BasicPlayer) that plays the sound.

Images and audio from Sid Meier's Civilization V, by Firaxis Games.
