# civ-5-asset-viewer
Program to see art and hear music from Civilization V.
The program references files (that are possibly copyright protected) local to my computer, so some references are replaced with placeholders and the actual files are not included.
The text driven menu sorts wonders either alphabetically or by era (then alphabetically) by referencing the csv file.
Then, it creates a JFrame that shows the art and starts a thread (with the help of BasicPlayer) that plays the sound.
